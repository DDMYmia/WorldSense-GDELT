# III. Security Considerations

To ensure the security of the WorldSense-GDELT platform's processing of global sentiment data, this project incorporates comprehensive security measures into its system design, covering data storage, transmission, access control, credential management, and log monitoring. The following are the platform's key security design strategies:

## A. Data Storage Security

### 1) Encrypted Storage
All sensitive data stored in Amazon S3 and OpenSearch is encrypted. S3 uses server-side encryption (SSE-S3) to ensure data confidentiality during storage; sensitive information in OpenSearch is encrypted using KMS (Key Management Service) to prevent unauthorized access.

### 2) Data Lifecycle Management
The platform uses S3 lifecycle rules to automatically transfer raw data to Amazon Glacier after 30 days. This low-cost archival storage service effectively controls costs for long-term storage of infrequently accessed data. Processed data is accessed only when needed, and outdated data is regularly purged.

## B. Data Transmission Security

### 1) Encrypted Transmission
All data transmitted within and outside the platform utilizes the HTTPS encryption protocol to ensure data security during network transmission and prevent interception or tampering.

### 2) API Access Control
When accessing data through the RESTful APIs provided by Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda, the platform uses IAM permission controls to ensure that only authorized users and systems can access sensitive data.

## C. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### 1) Fine-Grained Permission Control
The platform implements fine-grained access control through AWS IAM. Each user and service is granted the least privilege possible based on their role and task, allowing them to perform only the necessary operations. The system establishes three hierarchical roles: Project-Admin, Project-Developer, and Project-Viewer, with precisely defined permissions for cross-account collaboration among five external team members.

### 2) Roles and Policies
Team members' access to AWS resources is controlled through predefined roles and policies, ensuring that users can access only the data and services they require. Through IAM group and role management, the platform efficiently manages the permissions of different roles, ensuring legitimate and secure access.

## D. Credential and Secret Management

### 1) AWS Secrets Manager
All sensitive credentials (such as OpenSearch keys and API keys) are stored in AWS Secrets Manager, with automatic rotation enabled. This ensures the security of credentials and mitigates the risk of leakage.

### 2) Multi-Factor Authentication
The platform supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), requiring users and administrators to provide additional authentication when logging in and performing key operations. Session duration is limited to four hours maximum, reducing exposure windows while maintaining operational efficiency.

## E. Security Logging and Monitoring

### 1) CloudWatch Log Monitoring
Using Amazon CloudWatch, the platform collects and analyzes API call logs, Lambda execution logs, and OpenSearch query logs in real time. All abnormal behavior and security events are recorded in CloudWatch Logs and trigger alerts, helping the team respond to potential security threats promptly.

### 2) Anomaly Detection
Combining CloudWatch with AWS GuardDuty, the platform monitors potential security anomalies and potential attacks, promptly identifying and preventing threats such as DDoS attacks and unauthorized access. Automated response capabilities through Lambda functions ensure security responses occur within seconds of threat detection.

## F. User Data Privacy Protection

### 1) Data De-identification
To comply with data privacy laws and regulations, the platform de-identifies user data. For example, user location data is anonymized only when necessary during storage and transmission to prevent the disclosure of user privacy.

### 2) Compliance
The platform complies with relevant privacy regulations, such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), ensuring that user data is legally and securely protected.

## G. Security Incident Response and Disaster Recovery

### 1) Security Incident Response
The platform has a comprehensive security incident response process. Once abnormal behavior or signs of an attack are detected, the system automatically triggers an emergency response mechanism, including isolating the affected service, notifying relevant personnel, and initiating recovery procedures.

### 2) Disaster Recovery Design
The platform utilizes a multi-region deployment and data backup mechanism to ensure rapid recovery and minimize business losses in the event of data loss or service interruption.
